# Feature relationships (ERD-driven)

How the V1 modules interact, which entities they share, and where to factor
shared abstractions instead of duplicating logic.

## Module → entity ownership

| Module | Owns | Reads |
|---|---|---|
| Auth & eKYC | `USER`, `IDENTITY_VERIFICATION` | — |
| Properties/Listings | `PROPERTY`, `PROPERTY_IMAGE` | `USER` (owner), `IDENTITY_VERIFICATION` (publish gate), `USER_QUOTA` |
| Tenant Requests | `TENANT_REQUEST` | `USER` (tenant), eKYC |
| Offers | `OWNER_OFFER` | `TENANT_REQUEST`, `PROPERTY`, `USER_QUOTA` (`free_offers_left`) |
| Matchmaking | `MATCH_CONNECTION` (+ transient scores) | `PROPERTY` (APPROVED only), `TENANT_REQUEST` |
| Favorites | `FAVORITE` | `PROPERTY` |
| Reviews | `PROPERTY_REVIEW` | `PROPERTY`, `USER` (tenant) |
| Payments | `PAYMENT_TRANSACTION` | `USER`, `USER_QUOTA` (credited by webhook), `PROPERTY` (boost/listing target) |
| Contracts | `LEASE_CONTRACT` | `USER` ×2, `IDENTITY_VERIFICATION` (verified names/IDs), `PROPERTY` |
| B2B Partner Leads | `PARTNER_LEAD` | `USER` (tenant), triggered by offer acceptance |
| Notifications | `NOTIFICATION` | every module (event source) |
| Admin moderation | — (mutates others' `status`) | `IDENTITY_VERIFICATION`, `PROPERTY`, `TENANT_REQUEST`, `PROPERTY_REVIEW`, `PAYMENT_TRANSACTION`, `PARTNER_LEAD` |

## Shared entities (the cross-cutting ones)

- **`USER`** — read by everything. Role is a single enum (separate account per
  role, `conflicts.md` A1).
- **`IDENTITY_VERIFICATION`** — 1:1, **may be absent** (= `NOT_SUBMITTED`).
  Gates publishing a listing/request, accepting an offer, revealing contact.
  Every module that gates on it should use one shared hook, not re-derive.
- **`USER_QUOTA`** — landlord-only 1:1. Touched by Listings
  (`free_listings_left`), AI Optimizer (`optimizer_uses_left`), Offers
  (`free_offers_left`), and credited by Payments' webhook. **One `useQuota()`
  hook + one `<QuotaChip>`**, discriminated by field — not three
  implementations.
- **`PROPERTY.status`** — the single visibility gate. Only `APPROVED` is
  browsable/matchable/offerable. Also the trigger for the ChromaDB embedding
  pipeline (PRO-09).

## Cross-feature workflows

### 1. Reverse marketplace (the differentiator — end to end)
```
Tenant (eKYC APPROVED) creates TENANT_REQUEST      → status PENDING
Admin approves (anti-spam)                          → APPROVED  + NOTIFICATION(NEW_TENANT_REQUEST) to landlords
Landlord browses approved requests / is notified    → match score shown per own property
Landlord sends OWNER_OFFER (property + pitch + price)→ SENT      + decrement free_offers_left (or OFFER_PACK paywall)
Tenant opens offer                                  → VIEWED
Tenant accepts                                      → ACCEPTED   → MATCH_CONNECTION(CONNECTED) → PHONE REVEAL (both)
                                                    → TENANT_REQUEST → FULFILLED  [CONFIRM]
                                                    → B2B opt-in prompt → PARTNER_LEAD(PENDING)
```
Touches: Requests · Offers · Matchmaking · Quota · Payments · Notifications ·
Partner Leads · the PII gate. **This is the highest-risk integration in V1** —
build it as one vertical slice, not five disconnected screens.

### 2. Standard marketplace
```
Landlord (eKYC APPROVED) creates PROPERTY (+images) → PENDING (quota or NEW_LISTING payment)
Admin approves                                      → APPROVED + approved_by/at
                                                    → embedding pipeline (PRO-09) → browsable + matchable
Tenant browses/searches (SQL filters + semantic)     → ranked results w/ match score
Tenant favorites / shows interest                    → FAVORITE / MATCH_CONNECTION(INTERESTED)
```

### 3. Payment → quota
```
Landlord hits a quota wall → Paymob iframe → PAYMENT_TRANSACTION(PENDING)
webhook (HMAC + idempotent) → SUCCESS → USER_QUOTA credited → NOTIFICATION(PAYMENT_SUCCESS)
```
Client "success" = captured, **not** credited → poll the quota (see
`requirements.md` §2).

### 4. Moderation (4 queues, one shape)
`IDENTITY_VERIFICATION` · `PROPERTY` · `TENANT_REQUEST` · `PROPERTY_REVIEW` all
follow **PENDING → APPROVED/REJECTED**, all pushed live via Socket.io, all
emit a `NOTIFICATION`, all need reject-with-reason and 409-on-double-review.

## Duplication → shared abstractions

| Repeated concern | Abstraction |
|---|---|
| 4 moderation queues (identical shape) | one `<ModerationQueue>` / `<AdminDataTable>` parameterised by columns + actions + decision mutation |
| 3 quota fields + paywall | `useQuota(field)` + `<QuotaChip>` + `<PaywallSheet context>` (payment_type discriminant) |
| eKYC gating in 5 places | `useVerificationGate()` → `{ allowed, reason }` with distinct Arabic messages |
| PII masking/reveal | `<MaskedField>` + `useConnectionState(propertyId)` — reveal is **backend omission**, the component only renders what it got |
| Status pills across 5 entities | one `<StatusChip status>` over the ERD enums |
| Match score display | one `<MatchScoreRing score>` |
| 4 approve/reject flows | one `useModerationDecision(entity, id)` incl. 409 handling |
| Arabic/EGP/date formatting | `src/utils/format.ts` (`numberingSystem: "latn"`) |
| Socket.io events → toasts/queues | one `useRealtime(channel)` + `NOTIFICATION.type` switch |

## Normalization notes

- `PROPERTY_IMAGE` is separate (order + cover) — never assume `photos[0]`.
- `MATCH_CONNECTION` carries the stored score and is the **PII gate anchor**;
  `PROPERTY.contact_revealed` is too coarse (see `requirements.md` §1.2).
- `LEASE_CONTRACT` snapshots names/IDs/rent/address at generation time — it is
  intentionally denormalised; don't re-derive from live `USER`/`PROPERTY`.
- No entity exists for messaging, viewings, tickets, or admin sub-roles — do
  **not** create them (`conflicts.md` A3/B2).
